# Post-Change Checks

After making code changes, **always run appropriate checks** before considering the task complete.

## Decision Tree

| What Changed | Check to Run |
|--------------|--------------|
| Only whitespace/formatting | `trunk fmt` |
| Config files only (.json, .yaml, .mdc) | `trunk check --fix` on changed files |
| TypeScript/JavaScript code | `npm run typecheck` + `trunk check --fix` + tests if applicable |
| Test files | `npm run typecheck` + `npm test` (or `npm test -- <file>`) |

## Before Running Tests: Analyze Impact

**STOP and think** before running tests. Ask yourself:

1. **What behavior changed?** (new fields, renamed functions, changed return types, etc.)
2. **Which tests assert on that behavior?** (grep for function names, field names, expected values)
3. **Do those tests need updates?** If yes, update them FIRST before running

### Common patterns that break tests

| Change Made | Tests That Will Break |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Renamed/removed a function | Tests that call or mock that function |
| Changed function signature | Tests passing old argument patterns |
| Changed return type/shape | Tests asserting on old structure |
| Added required field | Tests creating objects without it |
| Changed error message | Tests asserting on exact error text |

### Workflow

```bash
# 1. Identify affected tests
rg "functionYouChanged" test/

# 2. Read and update those tests BEFORE running
# 3. Then run targeted tests
npm test -- test/unit/affected.test.ts
```

**Don't blindly run `npm test` hoping it passes** — anticipate failures and fix tests proactively.

## When to Run Tests

Run `npm test` when you modify a file that has an associated test file:

```bash
# Changed src/foo.ts → check for test/foo.test.ts or test/**/foo.test.ts
# Changed src/transformers/bar.ts → check for test/transformers/bar.test.ts
```

Use targeted test runs when possible: `npm test -- <test-file>`

## Trunk Commands (Prefer Over Direct Linters)

```bash
# ✅ GOOD
trunk fmt                              # Fast formatting only
trunk check --fix                      # Full lint + format + fix
trunk check --filter eslint --fix      # Targeted eslint only
trunk check src/index.ts --fix         # Single file check

# ❌ BAD - Don't invoke directly
npx eslint .
prettier --write .
```

## Workflow

1. Make code changes
2. Run `npm run typecheck` to catch type errors early
3. Run `trunk check --fix` (or `trunk fmt` if formatting-only)
4. If lint errors remain, fix them
5. If changed file has tests, run `npm test`
6. If tests fail, fix and re-run

## Manual Verification

Before presenting changes to the user, **actually run the feature yourself**:

1. Run tests for the changed code
2. Manually execute the feature with real inputs (use `test/fixtures/` for sample data)
3. Verify the output is correct

Don't just write code and ask the user to try it—confirm it works first.

## Final Validation

At the **end of a task or implementation**, run full project checks:

```bash
trunk check --all   # Ensure entire project is green
npm test            # Run full test suite
```

Then manually verify the feature works with sample data before presenting to user.

Only consider the task complete when:
- All type checks pass (`npm run typecheck`)
- All lints pass
- All tests pass
- You've manually verified the changes work

## Scoping Checks

For large changes, scope checks to modified files:
```bash
trunk check --fix src/index.ts src/types.ts
```
